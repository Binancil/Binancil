## Hey! Welcome to my account!

Hi, my name is Josh and me and my friend Alex run this account called Binancil.
This account will be run by both of us, so to know who's who let me say this:
I will create seperate repositories for my programs, and Alex will put all his into one repository.
We make programs in mainly python, but also other things if we feel like it. There isn't really a
category you could put us in, we just like to make what comes into our mind.

If you do use our stuff in any media, please credit us. We do a lot of hard work, and we'd like
more people to notice who we are. Also yes, forks are allowed, if anything they're encouraged. We'd love to see what you can make on top of our programs!
Please note that if you do you give credit some way or another. Claiming ownership of our stuff is not permitted. (duh)
